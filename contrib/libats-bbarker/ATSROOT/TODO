Understand how well CINT can deal with ATS-generated code.

Is there a callable interface in ROOT that can be used for an interpreter?
If so, can we program it to show the ATS expression but evaulate the generated C code?

If not, can we run CINT from the command line (much like a server, with the interpreted
session run in the background)? 

If so, research several REPLs, and find best prototype to implement in ATS.

Everything entered into an interpeter can be viewed as a
